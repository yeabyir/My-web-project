Project description
The JanHoy Tour & Travel Agency Website is a fully responsive, modern website designed to serve as the online storefront for a fictional travel agency. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site focuses on providing a clean, engaging user experience to showcase travel destinations, detail agency services, and allow customers to easily get in touch.
How to Use Your App
Using the JanHoy Tour & Travel Agency Website is straightforward, as it's designed to be a user-friendly source of information and an initial point of contact.

Browse the Homepage: Upon loading the site, you'll be greeted with a hero image and main call-to-action.

Explore Destinations: Scroll down or use the navigation links ("Destinations" or a similar section) to view various travel packages and locations offered by the agency.

Learn About Services: Navigate to sections like "About Us" or "Services" to understand what the agency offers, such as custom itineraries, group tours, or corporate travel.

Make an Inquiry (Booking): Go to the "Booking" or "Contact Us" section. Fill out the form with your name, contact information, and details about your desired trip (e.g., location, dates, number of travelers).

Submit: Click the "Send" or "Submit" button. (Note: On this front-end demonstration, the form data is collected but not sent to a live database or email server. In a production environment, this would initiate a connection with the agency.)
